# RNN-LSTM-GRU---Applications
This would be the codes for RNN. Please do not copy the code for your programming assignment and respect the Code of Cousera.

These codes are mainly used as an reference for future work and also to show some codes that I have done to find a entry level job as a Machine Learning Engineer(I have just graduated and I wish to find a job relate to AI)

I understand that I shouldn't publish these codes, and I will erase them right away after the recruiter have seen the codes I write.
